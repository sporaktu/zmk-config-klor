# ZMK CONFIG FOR THE KLOR SPLIT KEYBOARD

[Here](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/qmk-config-klor) you can find the QMK config for the KLOR.\
[Here](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/klor) you can find the hardware files and build guide.

KLOR is a 36-42 key column-staggered split keyboard. It supports a per key RGB matrix, encoders, OLED displays, a Pixart Paw3204 trackball and four different layouts, through brake off parts.

Polydactyl is the default layout. If you choose one of the other layouts you can use the matching template in the default keymap.


## HOW TO USE

- fork this repo
- `git clone` your repo, to create a local copy on your PC (you can use the [command line](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) or [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))
- adjust the klor.keymap file (find all the keycodes on [the zmk docs pages](https://zmk.dev/docs/codes/))
- `git push` your repo to your fork
- on the GitHub page of your fork navigate to "Actions"
- scroll down and unzip the `firmware.zip` archive that contains the latest firmware
- connect the left half of the KLOR to your PC, press reset twice
- the keyboard should now appear as a mass storage device
- drag'n'drop the `klor_left-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` file from the archive onto the storage device
- repeat this process with the right half and the `klor_right-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2` file.


## KNOWN ISSUES

- The encoder on the secondary side doesn't work yet. This is a limitation of ZMK.
- Need to add the code for the Pixart Paw3204 trackball.
